This module introduces the option to define a mother company for a company.  This is for customers who deals with companies which have multiple branches.  
Each branch can have a mother company. This makes possible:  

* The delivery could be done by the branch where de invoice is sent to the mother company. 
* The order could be made by the mother company and te delivery to the branche. 
* Customers could be group to a higher hierarchy so reporting is easier and more clear

We have developed different modules for making this happen which we offer to our customers in the Netherlands
